        <p class="intro-paragraph">
          At Deliverers of Zion Ministries International (DOZMI), we believe in
          equipping believers, serving communities, and fulfilling the Great
          Commission. Our ministries and outreach programs are designed to build
          faith, transform lives, and impact nations with the love and power of
          Christ.

            “Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he

          <p>
            Children are not just the future of the church—they are an active
            part of God’s kingdom today. We at DOZMI believe in shaping young
            hearts with biblical truths, strong moral values, and a deep love
            for God.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through interactive lessons, worship, and creative activities, we
            help children understand the Scriptures in ways that are engaging
            and life-changing. As 2 Timothy 3:15 reminds us, even a child can be
            wise through God’s Word.
          </p>
          <h3 class="ministry-subtitle">At Kids Church, we emphasize that:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Kids can be mature Christians – Growing in faith and character.
            </li>
            <li>
              Biblical values should be taught early – Establishing a firm
              foundation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Church should be fun and impactful – A place where kids love to
              learn about Jesus!
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="ministry-cta-paragraph">
            We welcome children of all ages to join us every Sunday for a
            dynamic, spirit-filled time of worship and the Word.
