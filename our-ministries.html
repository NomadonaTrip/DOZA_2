          equipping believers, serving communities, and fulfilling the Great
          Commission. Our ministries and outreach programs are designed to build
          faith, transform lives, and impact nations with the love and power of
          Christ.

            Children are not just the future of the church‚Äîthey are an active
            part of God‚Äôs kingdom today. We at DOZMI believe in shaping young
            hearts with biblical truths, strong moral values, and a deep love
            for God.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through interactive lessons, worship, and creative activities, we
            help children understand the Scriptures in ways that are engaging
            and life-changing. As 2 Timothy 3:15 reminds us, even a child can be
            wise through God‚Äôs Word.

              Kids can be mature Christians ‚Äì Growing in faith and character.
